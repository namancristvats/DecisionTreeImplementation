# DecisionTreeImplementation
1)Basic Implementation.
2)project
For Iris dataset your task is to print steps for every split in the decision tree.


Expected Output:
Level  0
Count of  0(False)  =  1
Count of  1(True)  =  3
Current Entropy  is =  0.811278124459
Splitting on feature  X1  with gain ratio  0.311278124459

Level  1
Count of  0  =  1
Count of  1  =  1
Current Entropy is =  1.0
Splitting on feature  X2  with gain ratio  1.0

Level  2
Count of  0  =  1
Current Entropy  is =  0.0
Reached leaf Node

Level  2
Count of  1  =  1
Current Entropy  is =  0.0
Reached leaf Node

Level  1
Count of  1  =  2
Current Entropy  is =  0.0
Reached leaf Node
